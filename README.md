# Angular JS
The purpose of this practice is to Train **Front End** developers to follow best practices, **improve** their logical thinking through progressive enhancement and help them feel **comfortable** asking questions and discussing possible solutions.
### Who is a mentor?
Your mentor is a Senior level developer who has about 0.5-1 hour a day allocated specifically to answer your questions and review your code.  Their goal is to help you clarify your doubts and check your code to improve your logic and problem solving.  They also make sure that you are following best practices. They give you feedback and make sure you are on the right track. If you feel lost or if you're not sure if what you're doing is correct, feel free to ask them openly. They're here to **help YOU!**
	
### How do I interact with my mentor?
1) **Daily meeting:**	This meeting will be ever day for around 15 minutes. You'll update your mentor on your daily progress, goals for the day and clear up any questions you might have. Please ask your mentor when they are available and make sure to keep track of any questions you might have that they can help you with. Remember no question is too simple not to ask :)						
							
2) **Resolving blockers/bugs by your mentor:**	You should meet twice with your mentor for around half an hour.  The idea of this meeting is that your mentor helps you to unblock your issues or your bugs.  They will explain possible solutions and best practices. They can help you improve certain aspects of your code through pair programming. 					
							
3) **Are you blocked?**		If you are blocked or you need a quick help. Do not waste time, write to your mentor immediately.

### How to start? 
Talk with your mentor, introduce yourself and agree on the time you will have your daily meeting with them. You need a talos email account and you need your slack account to be able to communicate with your mentor. If you do not have access to any of below items ask your immediate manager(SM/PO/Mentor) or HR to help you with this. 

Before taking this course, you should have at least an intermediate level of HTML and CSS. If you need a refresher, we made this course for you [Talos html and css course][13].  

You should also read the AngularJS Documentation. In these examples we asume that you have a previus knowlage about AngularJS and about web development [Angular Style Guide][3].

* If you are new to AngularJS please take a look at [Code School Angular Courses][1] and [Angular Documentation][2] there you can find enough information to get a better understanding about how AngularJS works.
* You should read the [Angular Style Guide][3] by johnpapa. There you will find examples of common errors and the best way to arrange your code. This is not the only way of coding with AngularJS, but itâ€™s a very good to way to understand how to use AngularJS efficiently. 

### Content
Take your time to work through the content. If you have any question, we will provide extra material in every practice so you can dig in deeper:

* 001 - [Project File Structure][4]
* 002 - [States, views and params][6]
* 003 - [Servers and Maps][7]
* 004 - [Directives][8]
* 005 - [Components][9]
* 006 - [Basic Testing][10]
* 007 - [End to End][11]
* 008 - [Testing Directives][12]

### Install
To run the examples run `gulp serve`. Each folder has it's own server and their own dependencies.

Check if you have the following dependencies:
* `nodejs v6`
* `bower`

Set up your environment, in each example folder:
* `npm install`
* `bower install`

> Runing this examples you may find troubles with the npm or the gulp task, please take a look at the documentation of the `gulp generator` [here][5], in which we base these practices.
