# 005 - Components 

The purpose of this example is to understand components both as a directive and as self contained views to use in routing

This example assumes you already know about routing and directives. If you haven't we recommend that you check out [Routing][1] and [Directives][2]

Also you may want to read the [documentation][3] about Components in AngularJS

### To Do
Perform the following in the current example:
* Refactor all routes to use components instead:
  * Create all components files, don't forget the bindings
* Change the 'userCard' directive to a component
